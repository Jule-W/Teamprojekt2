    <p> In the following you will take part in three short quizzes. The first two are verbal analogies tasks containing 10 questions each. The second one is a computational thinking test also containing 10 questions. Before every quiz you will get instructions with examples that show you what to expect. Please read the instructions carefully. You will need approximately 15 minutes in total.</p>

    <h1>Verbal Analogies Quiz</h1>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p align = "left">A verbal analogy question has four terms in two pairs. You are given the first complete pair, which establishes the relationship. You must then choose a pair of words whose relationship is <i>most</i> similar to the relationship in the given pair.
        
        One type of verbal analogy question gives the first pair of words and the first half of the second pair, followed by a list of possible matches. This kind of question looks like this:</p>
        
                            <p align = "center">CLOCK is to TIME as THERMOMETER is to</p>
        
        <p align = "left">The four answer choices are all single words. You must choose the one word that completes a relationship with thermometer that is analogous to the relationsship between clock and time.</p>

      <p align = "left"><b>Example 1</b></p>
      <p align = "left"><b>1.</b> SPEEDOMETER is to POINTER as WATCH is to <br />
        <b>(A)</b> case <br />
        <b>(B)</b> hands <br />
        <b>(C)</b> dial <br />
        <b>(D)</b> numerals <br />
       </p>
      <p align = "left"><b>The correct answer is (B).</b> First consider what a <i>pointer</i> is used for on a <i>speedometer</i>. It indicates speed at a particular moment. A <i>watch</i> uses <i>hands</i> (choice B) for the same general function, that is, to indicate something at a particular moment. In this case, the hands indicate time. Choice (A), <i>case</i>, is incorrect because the watch case has nothing to do with this function. Choices (C), <i>dial</i>, and (D), <i>numerals</i>, are wrong because although the dial and the numbers have to do with indicating time, they don't perform the specific function of indicating something at any one particular moment.</p>
      
      <p align = "left"><b>Example 2</b></p>
      <p align = "left"><b>2.</b> WINTER is to SUMMER as COLD is to <br />

        <b>(C)</b> warm <br />
        <b>(D)</b> freezing <br />
       </p>
      <p align = "left"><b>The correct answer is (C).</b> <i>Winter</i> and <i>summer</i> are opposites, so you should look for an answer choice that means the opposite of <i>cold</i>.</p>

    <h1>Verbal Analogies Quiz 2</h1>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p align = "left">Similar to the first quiz, a verbal analogy question has four terms in two pairs. In each question, the two capitalized words have a certain relationship to eachother. Select the letter of the pair of words that are related in the same way as the two capitalized words.

        One type of verbal analogy question gives the first pair of words, followed by a list of possible matches. This kind of question looks like this:</p>

                            <p align = "center">INTIMIDATE:FEAR :: </p>

        <p align = "left">The four answer choices are all pair of words You must choose the one pair that has the most similar relationship as the given pair.</p>

      <p align = "left"><b>1.</b> SPELLING : PUNCTUATION :: <br />
        <b>(A)</b> pajamas : fatigue <br />

        <b>(C)</b> bandage : cut <br />
        <b>(D)</b> biology : physics <br />
       </p>
      <p align = "left"><b>The correct answer is (D).</b> <i>Spelling</i> and <i>punctuation</i> are parts of the mechanics of English. Biology and physics are parts of the field of science. Therefore, the pair of words with the most analogous relationsship to the given pair is answer choice (D). In this type of question, it may help to substitute the colons for words when you read the question in your head. You would read the example like this: "Spelling is to punctuation as _______ is to _______."</p>

      <h1>Computational Thinking Test</h1>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <p align = "left">In the following you will take part in a computational thinking test. Don't worry, to solve this you don't need any prior knowledge in computer science and programming. You will be given a picture with a main-character and a path which this character wants to follow. To the right of this picture there will be given four different options of instructions. One of those instructions will match the given scenario and this is the instruction you have to find.</p>
        
        <p align = "left">Before starting the test, we are going to see three examples so you can familiarise yourself with the kind of questions that you will find, and the characters that will appear.</p>
      
      <img src="../mturk-timing-test/images/Characters_ex3.PNG" alt="Char picture" width="500" ></img>
      
      <hr>
      
    <p align = "left"><b>Example 1</b></p>
      <p align = "left">In the first example you are asked which instructions take 'Pac-Man' to the ghost by the path marked out. That is to take 'Pac-Man' EXACTLY to the square where the ghost is (without going over or stopping short), and strictly following the path marked in yellow (without touching the walls, represented by the orange squares).</p>
    <img src="../mturk-timing-test/images/exmpl1_ex3.PNG" alt="Sample picture1" width="690" ></img>
     <p align = "left">The correct answer is (B).</p>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    
    <p align = "left"><b>Example 2</b></p>
      <p align = "left">In the second example you are asked again which instructions take 'Pac-Man' to the ghost by the path marked out. However, in this question the options are presented as groups of instruction blocks rather than arrows.</p>
    <p align = "left">Remember that the question asks you to take 'Pac-Man' EXACTLY to the square where the ghost is, and strictly following the path marked in yellow.</p>
    <img src="../mturk-timing-test/images/exmpl2_ex3.PNG" alt="Sample picture2" width="690" ></img>
     <p align = "left">The correct answer is (C).</p>
    <p> <br /> </p>

    <p align = "left"><b>Example 3</b></p>
      <p align = "left">In the third example you are asked which instructions the artist should follow to draw the shape on screen. That is, how to MOVE the pencil to draw the shape.</p>
    <p align = "left">The MOVE instrucion pushes the pencil whilst drawing, while the JUMP instruction makes the artist jump to another location without drawing. The grey arrow indicates the direction of the first movement of the pencil.</p>
    <img src="../mturk-timing-test/images/exmpl3_ex3.PNG" alt="Sample picture3" width="690" ></img>
     <p align = "left">The correct answer is (A).</p>
